                                Many large companies are composed of a number of smaller sub-companies, each with their own levels of income and expense. These sub-companies can be categorized by their profitability, either generating excess income (a funding source) or being in need of outside income (a funding sink). Ordinarily, companies that require extra income would need to request funding from an external source such as a bank. Being part of a larger company, however, allows funds to be easily loaned between sources and sinks. Currently, sources are matched to sinks manually by a company employee. Given the high level of complexity of the problem and the large space of possible solutions, manually created matches are liable to be sub-optimal. Having sub-optimal matches increases the total amount of funding required to satisfy all requirements, causing the company to rely on third-party funding which is provided at higher interest rates, costing the company money. In addition, manually matching sources to sinks requires a significant amount of employee time which could otherwise be spent gaining value for the company elsewhere.

                                <h3>Optimization</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The goal of the optimization portion of the project is to find a way of creating a set of allocations which satisfies all funding requirements at the lowest total cost.
                                    We investigate only the use of metaheuristic approaches, specifically considering Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization.<br/>
                                    We also implement a greedy heuristic, which is based on a description of the manual process that is currently in use. We use this as a baseline to compare the metaheuristics against.
                                    The main questions that we aim to answer are whether or not our metaheuristics perform better than the existing manual or heuristic approaches, and which of them performs the best.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Visualization</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The goal of the visualisation portion of the project is to create a interactive visualisation that will help users understand the allocation data.
                                    We aim to use a UCD (User-centered design) process to design a visualisation that answers a number of visual queries specified by Old Mutual Employees.
                                    By allowing users to easily answer these visual queries we allow them to understand the data more quickly and completely than would be possible with purely textual tools.<br/>
                                    The visual queries specified were:
                                    <figure>
                                        <img id = "vQueries" src="images/vis_queries.png" style = "scale: 55%"/>
                                        <figcaption>
                                            Visual queries can be split into two meta queries: 'What is the solution?' and 'Is the solution good?' Within these groups queries are listed in order of importance.

                                <p>
								In the initial design cycle users where enthusiastic about the designs presented. This indicated
                                that the initial data gathering and use of the design principles was successful. Although the initial
                                design was well received there were still a number of issues with it.</p><p>
                                The pilot tests, conducted by
                                HCI Honours students at UCT for both the paper-prototype and highfidelity prototype were helpful,
                                especially to identify weaknesses in the evaluation procedure. For the paper proto-type particularly
                                the initial evaluation procedure was improved greatly by using hard copies of the images and having
                                the visual queries present for reference at all times. Having a variety of participants in the overall
                                evaluation process allowed us to pick up on more weaknesses than an evaluation procedure with a single
                                specific group of participants.</p><p>
                                Expert end user testing allowed for the visual queries to be more
                                precisely defined and for features that were not well suited to the specific use cases encountered by
                                end users to be improved. Progressing from the paper-prototype to the low-fidelity prototype a number
                                of improvements were suggested and implemented. Incorporating end users in the design process allowed for us to create a visualisation that fulfilled their goals.</p><p>
                                However, there were some issues with this testing. For example There is certainly an element of learning in the testing process and users would 
                                possibly pick up on visual cues explained during earlier evaluations that new users would not.
                                The UCD process resulted in a successful design but it required a substantial amount of time, planning and management to arrange evaluations and process feedback.
                                Unfortunately, this meant that the creation of a high fidelity prototype was incomplete. This was partly due to the unexpected complexity of developing an interactive visual system and partly
                                due to the UCD process taking more time than expected. </p><p>
                                Fortunoately, the main aspects of interactivity and automated construction of the visualisation from a JSON format were completed.
                                Users clearly felt that this was an improvement over the initial design and that it was a viable replacement or complement to existing tools.
								There is still room for improvement of both the design and implementation as well as an opportunity for a number of similar visualisations to fulfil the same role for different tasks in the financial sector.
