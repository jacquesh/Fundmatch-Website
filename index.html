            Many large companies are composed of a number of smaller sub-companies, each with
            their own levels of income and expense. These sub-companies can be categorized by
            their profitability, either generating excess income (a funding source) or being in
            need of outside income (a funding sink). Ordinarily, companies that require extra income
            would need to request funding from an external source such as a bank. Being part of
            a larger company, however, allows funds to be easily loaned between sources and sinks.
            Currently, sources are matched to sinks manually by a company employee. Given the high
            level of complexity of the problem and the large space of possible solutions,
            manually created matches are liable to be sub-optimal. Having sub-optimal matches
            increases the total amount of funding required to satisfy all requirements, causing
            the company to rely on third-party funding which is provided at higher interest rates,
            costing the company money. In addition, manually matching sources to sinks requires a
            significant amount of employee time which could otherwise be spent gaining value for the
            company elsewhere.
